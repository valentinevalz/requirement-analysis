# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository explores the essential phase of *Requirement Analysis* in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It serves as a guide to understanding, gathering, analyzing, and documenting software requirements to ensure successful project delivery.

---

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying user needs and determining the conditions that a software system must satisfy. It involves gathering requirements from stakeholders, analyzing them for feasibility, documenting them clearly, and validating their correctness.

This phase is crucial in the SDLC as it ensures that developers and stakeholders have a mutual understanding of what the system should do, reducing costly misunderstandings and rework.

---

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarity and Scope Definition:** It clearly outlines what the system is expected to do, helping to avoid scope creep.
- **Improved Communication:** Acts as a bridge between clients, stakeholders, and the development team.
- **Cost and Time Efficiency:** Prevents costly revisions by getting the requirements right from the start.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting needs from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and observations.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Digging deeper into stakeholder needs to uncover hidden or implicit requirements.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Writing clear, concise, and testable requirement specifications.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Organizing and structuring requirements using models and diagrams.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Confirming that the documented requirements reflect stakeholder needs and are feasible.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

These define specific behaviors or functions of the system.

**Examples for Booking Management System:**
- Users can search for available bookings.
- Admins can add or update booking listings.
- System sends confirmation emails after successful booking.

### Non-functional Requirements

These define the system's performance, usability, and constraints.

**Examples:**
- The system should load search results in under 3 seconds.
- It must support up to 1,000 concurrent users.
- The platform should have a 99.9% uptime.

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent how users (actors) interact with the system and its features.

**Benefits:**
- Easy visualization of system functionality
- Helps define system scope
- Enhances communication between stakeholders and developers

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are predefined conditions that a software feature must meet to be accepted by the client.

**Importance:**
- Ensures a shared understanding between developers and stakeholders.
- Provides a basis for test cases and quality assurance.

**Example – Checkout Feature:**
- User must be logged in to proceed to checkout.
- All required fields (name, payment info, etc.) must be filled.
- Payment must be processed securely with confirmation displayed.
- System should send a confirmation email post-checkout.
